            Welcome to Poignant Poetry, your one stop shop for all things poetic. Poetry is a form of literature that expresses the narrator's
            emotions and feelings. There are four types of poems: lyric poems,
            narrative poems, humorous poems, and concrete poems. Lyric poems are short poems that depict
            a short period of time. It gives the reader imagery, usually expressing 
            the poet's past experiences or wishes. Most of our poems on this website are lyric poems.
